# purescript-cardano-data-lite

This is a PureScript wrapper for [`@mlabs-haskell/cardano-data-lite`](https://github.com/mlabs-haskell/cardano-data-lite/). This library aims to be a drop in replacement for [`purescript-cardano-serialization-lib`](https://github.com/mlabs-haskell/purescript-cardano-serialization-lib).

## How to use the library

Most likely you would want to use [`purescript-cardano-types`](https://github.com/mlabs-haskell/purescript-cardano-types) - that library provides a nice purely-functional interface on top of these raw bindings.
